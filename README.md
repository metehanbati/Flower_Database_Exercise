At every sale we can have a combination of many flowers. All the flowers are charged per item. The customer may want many branches of many types of flowers. The customer may pay in 3 ways cash, credit - debit card or transaction direct to our account. combination of payment are not accepted. the customers have elasticity in paymanets such as installment. we identify each customer by their phone number. the customer buys flowers, they can pick up from our store or we can deliver with extra charge.
